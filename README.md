## datasets

* employees

The database contains about 300,000 employee records with 2.8 million salary entries. The export data is 167 MB, which is not huge, but heavy enough to be non-trivial for testing.

The data was generated, and as such there are inconsistencies and subtle problems. Rather than removing them, we decided to leave the contents untouched, and use these issues as data cleaning exercises.
